# 🏅 Sport timer web app

I created this app to make my trainings more comfortable. It solves the problem of starting multiple timers during short and long break and traning time control. I hope it will be useful for other people.

## How to install
```
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/egorbabintcev/fitness-timer.git

# Set up all dependencies (node.js required)
type 'yarn' or 'npm install'

# Start development local server on localhost:3000
yarn start

# Build the project from source files (result in ./public folder)
yarn build
```
